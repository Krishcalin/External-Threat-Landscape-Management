"""Time-based one-time passwords (RFC 6238) — pure, stdlib-only.

Ported from OverWatch's `aws_totp.py`, which is the same author's and solves the
same problem; the reasoning below is kept rather than restated, because the
reasons are the load-bearing part.

CORRECTNESS IS TESTABLE HERE, SO IT IS TESTED AGAINST THE SPECIFICATION.
RFC 6238 Appendix B publishes a table of (time, expected code) for a known seed.
`tests/test_totp.py` asserts against those vectors, which is proof of
interoperability with every conforming authenticator app — as opposed to proof
that this file agrees with itself, which is all a round-trip test of a
hand-rolled scheme would give.

WHY SHA-1, WHICH LOOKS WRONG AT FIRST GLANCE
---------------------------------------------
RFC 6238 permits SHA-1, SHA-256 and SHA-512, and the default is SHA-1. Microsoft
Authenticator and Google Authenticator ignore the `algorithm=` parameter and
assume SHA-1; an enrolment advertising SHA-256 silently produces codes that never
match, and the user experiences that as "your app is broken".

It is also not the SHA-1 weakness that matters. The break is collision
resistance, and HMAC-SHA-1 does not rely on it — the construction is still sound
and the secret is 160 bits of urandom. Interoperability wins.

WHAT THIS MODULE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
------------------------------------------
It does not remember which codes have been used. A TOTP code stays valid for its
whole time step, so the same six digits replay happily for up to 30 seconds (90
with the drift window) unless somebody records the last counter accepted per
user. That is STATE, so it belongs in the store — `core/auth_store.py` does it —
and the omission is called out here because "verify returned True" reads like the
whole job and is not.
